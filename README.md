# Leaflet Challenge: Earthquake Visualization

## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

### Description

This project visualizes earthquake data using **Leaflet**, leveraging real-time data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The dataset, updated every 5 minutes, maps earthquake occurrences based on their geographic coordinates. 

Each data point represents:
- **Magnitude**: Visualized by the size of the marker.
- **Depth**: Visualized by the marker's color.

The goal is to provide an intuitive and interactive way to understand the distribution and impact of seismic activities globally.
